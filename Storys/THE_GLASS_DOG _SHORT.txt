THE GLASS DOG





An accomplished wizard once lived on the top floor of a tenement

house and passed his time in thoughtful study and studious thought.

What he didn't know about wizardry was hardly worth knowing, for he

possessed all the books and recipes of all the wizards who had lived

before him; and, moreover, he had invented several wizardments

himself.

This admirable person would have been completely happy but for the

numerous interruptions to his studies caused by folk who came to

consult him about their troubles (in which he was not interested),

and by the loud knocks of the iceman, the milkman, the baker's boy,

the laundryman and the peanut woman. He never dealt with any of

these people; but they rapped at his door every day to see him about

this or that or to try to sell him their wares. Just when he was

most deeply interested in his books or engaged in watching the

bubbling of a cauldron there would come a knock at his door. And

after sending the intruder away he always found he had lost his

train of thought or ruined his compound.
