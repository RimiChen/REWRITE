    "paragraph": "The China, in leaving, seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg's last hope.  None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects.  The Pereire, of the French Transatlantic Company, whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort, did not leave until the 14th; the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London, but to Havre; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would render Phileas Fogg's last efforts of no avail.  The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day, and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager. ",

It was his fault, for, instead of helping his master, he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path!  And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour, when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account, when he thought that the immense stake, added to the heavy charges of this useless journey, would completely ruin Mr. Fogg, he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations.  Mr. Fogg, however, did not reproach him; and, on leaving the Cunard pier, only said: \"We will consult about what is best to-morrow.  Come.\" ",

From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days, thirteen hours, and forty-five minutes.

He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson, and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river, for any that were about to depart.  Several had departure signals, and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe.  But they were mostly sailing vessels, of which, of course, Phileas Fogg could make no use. ",
